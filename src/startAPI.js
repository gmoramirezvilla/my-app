In Programming ASP.NET, Third Edition, authors Jesse Liberty and Dan Hurwitz give you the lowdown on the technology's latest version, ASP.NET 2.0, as well as Visual Studio 2005. Among the most significant improvements to ASP.NET 2.0 are new server controls and services that make you dramatically more productive. In fact, when compared to its predecessor, ASP.NET 2.0 reduces the amount of code you have to write by about 75%. Creating interactive web applications has never been easier-but that still doesn't mean it's hassle-free! The difficulty in ASP.NET 2.0 is that it's so complete and flexible that there are many pieces that must be woven together to build a robust, scalable, and efficient application. Fortunately, Programming ASP.NET, Third Edition is on the case, dispensing all the information you need to be effective with this dynamic tool. For starters, the book features a comprehensive tutorial on Web Forms, the user interface that gives web applications their look and feel. It then offers detailed explanations of all new controls, including web server controls, HTML controls, and custom controls. Used properly, these controls are able to take care of nearly all the foundation work-security, data access, layout, etc.-that you would normally have to write yourself. Free of these burdensome tasks, you can instead focus on your specific application. Other new material found in this updated edition even shows you how to create ASP.NET 2.0 pages for mobile devices. With Programming ASP.NET, Third Edition at your side, there's virtually no end to the programming possibilities.",

          "description": "In the three years since Microsoft made C# available, there have been lots of tweaks to the language. That's because C# is not only essential for making .NET work, it's a big way for Microsoft to attract millions of Java, C and C++ developers to the platform. And C# has definitely made some inroads. Because of its popularity among developers, the language received standardization from ECMA International, making it possible to port C# applications to other platforms. To bolster its appeal, C# 2.0 has undergone some key changes as part of Visual Studio 2005 that will make development with .NET quicker and easier.That's precisely what Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook allows you to do. There are some great new features in C# and this unique \"all lab, no lecture\" guide covers them all with 50 hands-on projects. Each project explores a new feature, with emphasis on changes that increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and add functionality to applications.C#'s component-based design combines the productivity of Microsoft's popular Visual Basic with the raw power of C++ for web-based applications. Many reviewers note a similarity between C# and Java--in fact, a new feature that took the Java development team five years to incorporate into Java is now available in C# 2.0. Called \"generics\", this feature enables developers to reuse and customize their existing code, so they can dramatically cut down the time it takes to develop new applications.Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook is full of no-nonsense code without the usual page-filling commentary. You'll find suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation, plus practical notes and warnings. The book also tells developers how to acquire, install and configure Visual Studio 2005. Are you a coder to the core? Learn what C# 2.0 can do for you now.",

          "description": "Objective-C Programmer's Reference provides the tools necessary to write software in Objective-C—the language of choice for developing iOS and OS X applications. Author Carlos Oliveira begins from the basic building blocks of the language. He shows how to create correct and efficient applications by applying your knowledge of object-oriented and structured programming. This book: Takes you quickly through fundamental concepts such as interfaces and class implementations. Provides a concise reference to the Foundation Framework that is all-important when programming in Objective-C. Highlights key differences between Objective-C and other popular languages such as Java or Python. Provides the fundamentals of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, which are the standard for OS X and iOS development. Objective-C Programmer's Reference makes extensive use of concepts already mastered by developers who are fluent in other languages such as C++, Java, Perl, and Python. The author’s approach is logical and structured, and even novice developers will have an easy time absorbing the most important topics necessary to program in Objective-C. Objective-C Programmer's Reference is a book for professional developers in Objective-C, or those who are moving to Objective-C from other languages. The book is written for readers who lack the time to invest in more traditional books, which usually spend hundreds of pages to explain concepts that are part of the working programmer’s standard vocabulary. What you’ll learn Grasp the basic syntax of the Objective-C language. Create classes and methods in Objective-C. Apply Objective-C’s message-passing mechanism to simplify your code and avoid deep class hierarchies. Store and access dynamic data through Objective-C’s built-in, key-value system. Make effective use of container classes such as arrays and dictionaries with their immutable and mutable versions. Create simple applications for iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, and other iOS and Mac OS X devices. Who this book is for Objective-C Programmer's Reference is for programmers in Objective-C who are looking for a handy reference to keep them on top of their game. The book is also designed for programmers moving to Objective-C from some other language, especially from another C-like language such as Java or C#, providing just that additional bit that is needed to transfer their expertise into Objective-C and get a leg up on creating applications for the iOS and OS X platforms underlying Apple’s hugely successful devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and Macbook.

The nature of the research demands collaboration in medicine, biology, physics, engineering, computer science, and statistics; and SPBEI attempts to expedite and strengthen the exploration and systemization of interdisciplinary knowledge. This year, the conference received a large number of submissions around the globe, and all papers have been rigorously reviewed by a large number of peer reviewers who have spent tremendous amount of time and effort on the evaluations, with each paper receiving three to six reviews. We would like to thank all those who submitted papers for considerations, and we extend our sincere gratitude to all those who devoted their time and effort professionally to ensuring the high standards of the technical program, including the authors, committee members, peer reviewers, and session chairs.",

It is a powerful server-based technology designed to create dynamic, interactive, HTML pages for web sites and corporate intranets. ASP.NET is a core element of Microsoft's exciting .NET vision, building on the strengths of the .NET Framework to provide many new features not seen in previous versions of ASP. This book, entirely revised and updated for the final release, will provide you with a step-by-step introduction to ASP.NET using C#, with plenty of worked examples to help you to gain a deep understanding of what ASP.NET is all about, and how you can harness it to build powerful web applications. What does this book cover? In this book, you will learn how to Create basic ASP.NET pages with C# Understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming Work with data and XML Debug and handling errors in your code Use ASP.NET Server Controls Create user controls and components Explore the world of Web services Optimize performance Secure your application By the end of this book you will be able to understand, adapt, maintain and secure ASP.NET web sites with ease. Who is this book for? This book is aimed at relatively inexperienced web builders who are looking to enrich their sites with dynamically-generated content, and want to learn how to start building web applications using ASP.NET. Developers who have a little experience with previous versions of ASP (and are looking to move over to ASP.NET), may also find this book helpful in getting a simple grasp on what ASP.NET is, what it does, and how it can be used. Experience of basic HTML is required, but previous experience of ASP is not essential. We'll be teaching the basics of C# in this book, so prior experience with the language is not required.",

In addition, this volume features three papers from the ECOWS’08 business track. WEWST focuses on research contributions advancing the state of the art in Web Services technologies. The main goal of the WEWST workshop is to serve as a forum for providing early exposure and much needed feedback to grow and establish original and emerging ideas within the Web Services community. The widevarietyoftools,techniques,andtechnologicalsolutionspresentedinWEWST share one common feature – they advance the current Web Services research in new directions by introducing new, sometimes controversial ideas into the ?eld. As such, WEWST is the natural extension to the main ECOWS conference. For this edition of WEWST, we accepted 6 full papers and 3 short papers. We would like to thank the paper authors for their submissions and for their contribution to the timely preparation of these proceedings, as well as for their presentations and lively discussions during the workshop. At the same time, we would like to thank our ProgramCommittee for their work and for submitting the reviewsontime.Lastbutnotleast,wewouldliketothank theECOWSconference organizers for their help organizing a successful workshop.",

          "description": "From Ross Mathews, the nationally bestselling author of Man Up!, judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race, and alum of Chelsea Lately, comes “a delightful mix of sweet and sour celebrity experiences” (Shelf Awareness) in this hilarious and irreverent collection of essays. Pretend it’s happy hour and you and I are sitting at the bar. I look amazing and, I agree with you, much thinner in person. You look good, too. Maybe it’s the candlelight, maybe it’s the booze. Either way, let’s just go with it. Keep this all between you and me, and do me a favor? Don’t judge me if I name drop just a little. Television personality Ross Mathews likes telling stories. He was always outrageous and hilariously honest, even when the biggest celebrity he knew was his favorite lunch lady in the school cafeteria. Now that he has Hollywood experience—from interning behind the scenes at The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to judging RuPaul’s Drag Race—he has a lot to talk about. In Name Drop, Ross dishes about being an unlikely insider in the alternate reality that is showbiz, like that time he was invited by Barbara Walters to host The View—only to learn his hero did not suffer fools; his Christmas with the Kardashians, which should be its own holiday special; and his news-making talk with Omarosa on Celebrity Big Brother, which, as it turns out, was just the tip of the iceberg. Holding nothing back, Ross shares the most treasured and surprising moments in his celebrity-filled career, and proves that while exposure may have made him a little bit famous, he is still as much a fanboy as ever. Filled with “charmingly told” (Booklist) tales ranging from the horrifying to the hilarious—and with just the right “Rossipes” and cocktails to go along with them—Name Drop is every pop culture lover’s dream come true.",
